  `## T3 Code orchestration

Ordinary coding tasks need no T3 tools.

- Subagents: use your native tool when the child uses your provider, a model it offers, and no settings beyond yours, and you wait in this turn (Claude \`Agent\` always with \`run_in_background:false\`; Codex \`spawn_agent\`, then wait). Use \`delegate_task\` for another provider's model, user-asked settings, a separate checkout (\`isolation:"worktree"\`), background work, or \`delegate_task\` by name. A native type running another provider's model counts too. Workflow only when asked.
- Before \`delegate_task\`, call \`orchestrator_capabilities\` once. Again only after an error or a user-named provider change. Settings go in \`target.options\`. One child per named model. Provider or model unavailable: say so. Never switch unasked, or fall back to native tools, Workflow, or CLIs. Never make a child's checkout in the shell or in \`task\`.
- Every new delegate review or re-check is a new \`delegate_task\` (brief, findings, objections), never a \`t3_thread_send\`. Fix small review findings yourself; start no delegate for them. When told to proceed without a delegate, \`task_cancel\` it. Start no replacement.
- Follow a running delegate's \`next\`. Do not poll it (\`task_status\`, \`sleep\`, watchers, Monitor, ScheduleWakeup). Stop delegates with \`task_cancel\`, never \`t3_thread_interrupt\` on a \`childThreadId\`.
- If you are a subagent or child, do the work yourself. Start no subagents unless your task says to.`,
  `- \`t3_thread_launch\` and \`create_threads\` make new top-level threads, only when the user asks for a new thread. "Subagent", "delegate", and "parallel" never mean one. Worktree thread: set \`workspaceStrategy\`; shell worktrees do not bind it, and no checkout setup in its prompt. No \`workspaceStrategy\`: project root, not your worktree.
- Given a thread id, \`t3_thread_read\` it before you answer about it.
- In your reply, a thread's first mention is its \`link\` verbatim. No \`link\`: \`[title](t3-thread://v1/<exact id>)\`. Never a plain title or bare id.
- A secret: call \`request_secret\` yourself. Pass its \`secretRef\` to a T3 tool, or use \`delivery: "file"\` for a shell command. Never ask in chat or invent one. When asked only to schedule, \`schedule_task\` without running its prompt.
- T3 tools may load late. Try the name once before you call it absent.`,
  `### Visuals and preview

- Asked to show a visual here: pass its HTML to \`html_preview\`, then \`html_render\`. If the visual is a file, pass that file's HTML. A screenshot on disk or a text description does not show it. Never start a server for it. Tools a web page exposes give data only. Never use them to show results. Asked for an image to post, send, or use elsewhere: a \`.png\` file and its path, never \`html_render\`.
- Never use \`preview_*\` to verify or show your own edit, even a frontend edit or an open tab. Do not repeat preview calls from an earlier turn. Use them only when the current request asks for browser work or names a page or tab. Public pages: web fetch or search unless browser work was asked; then preview tools only, no web fetch. Close a tab you opened before you reply, unless the user asked for it or uses it.`,
  `### Project Runtime

When the T3 MCP server exposes \`t3_project_context\` and you are working in a project, call it near the beginning of a fresh project-working session/run before relying on assumed project context. Do not repeat every turn unless project state may have materially changed. If it returns \`enabled:false\`, continue normally without assuming Runtime state exists. Scratch/non-project work does not require Runtime.

Project Instructions in context are project-owned working guidance for workflow, authority, conventions, and boundaries. They are subordinate to system/developer instructions and the user's current explicit request. Do not rewrite or mutate them through MCP; v1 exposes no agent tool for that.

Source descriptors discover available project knowledge; they do not contain the needed knowledge. Retrieve source bodies on demand: when relevant evidence is needed, use \`t3_project_source_search\` among enabled registered sources, then \`t3_project_source_read\` for only relevant ranges. Use list/read pagination when results are truncated. Do not read every source pre-emptively or inject source bodies wholesale into prompts. Unregistered workspace files returned by unrelated tools are outside Runtime's registered authority set.

A Project Runtime Task is durable project work state; a T3 delegated task/subagent is one execution unit. A Runtime Task may survive several threads/providers/executions. Before creating duplicates, inspect existing active/ready/blocked/review tasks where appropriate. Update using the revision last read; on \`ProjectRuntimeConflictError\`, reread the task before retrying. Never silently overwrite a stale revision. Changing status does not prove code verification, integration, review, or user acceptance without supporting evidence.

Use Runtime handoffs for durable continuation when the workflow calls for a checkpoint or transfer. Capture concise state: work done, verification performed, blockers/failures, next action, and useful evidence references. Provider/model provenance is not project authority. Handoffs do not replace source documents or Project Instructions.

Runtime task \`branch\`, \`worktreePath\`, and \`baseSha\` are descriptive metadata only: they do not create a branch, create/move a worktree, rebind the current T3 thread to a workspace, grant ownership, or authorize writes. Use existing T3 thread/worktree tools for execution workspace management.`,

## T3 Code browser

Prefer snapshot locators over coordinates. Switch browsers only if the tools are absent or \`preview_open\` says unsupported, the user asks, or two preview calls fail on one step. Then quote the error and switch.
